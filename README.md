-Briefly summarize the DriverPass project. Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

In this project, the task was to design a system that DriverPass could implement for their students to schedule appointments for driving lessons and purchase packages that would contain classes and practice tests. The client in this scenario was DriverPass, a company that was started to assist new drivers in the process of obtaining their drivers license. The type of system they wanted to create was a web-based system that would allow users to access their site, regardless of the platform or device that they were using.

-What did you do particularly well?

I feel as though i was able to understand the needs of DriverPass and create a system that serves all functions that they requested. Reading the interview and gathering all necessary information to create the exact system they wanted was something i did particularly well.

-If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

One thing that i feel i could revise and rework, would be the UML class diagram that was created for the second project. If i were to go back through, i would have made sure that everything aligned and made sense in terms of compositions and inheritence.

-How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

Interpreting the user's needs is one of the most important aspects when designing a system. Making sure to take everything into consideration and make sure that it makes sense of the client side was crucial in completing this system. Looking through the eyes of the user really solidified the understanding of how the system should be designed. Making sure that this viewpoint is met will only ensure the success of the system because you have looked at it through the eyes of someone using the system for the first time.

-How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

Personally, i see desinging software as a work of art. By this i mean, when you are beginning the process of making something from scratch, you must interpret things in your own way, but at the same time have the time to implement nuances that may be beneficial to the end-user. Being to have your own creative freedom, but still consider the needs of the client and end-users is something that really resonates with me. I also believe that testing is a major part of software design as it will only lead to success.
